# ucllecturecrashers
## What it is
A project created for the UCL API hackathon.
## Inspiration
We like to crash lectures sometimes, and thought it would be great to do it more officially by auditing courses.
## What it does
It streamlines the process of 'crashing' or auditing lectures up until pre-writing a custom email to the lecturer.
## How we built it
Using Flask and UCL API.
## Challenges we ran into
The semantic search was quite difficult so we had to settle on a comprimise.
## Requirements
 - flask, requests, pandas, spacy, numpy (install using pip)
 - enter the following command: python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
