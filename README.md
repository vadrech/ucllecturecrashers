# ucllecturecrashers
## Inspiration
We like to crash lectures sometimes, and thought it would be great to do it more officially.
## What it does
It streamlines the process of 'crashing' or auditing lectures up until pre-writing a custom email to the lecturer.
## How we built it
Using Flask and UCL API.
## Challenges we ran into
The semantic search was quite difficult so we had to settle on a comprimise.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It kind of works.
## What we learned
How to build an MVP to pitch.
## What's next for UCL Lecture Crashers
This could be developed further in accordance with UCL guidelines to streamline the process of auditing courses at ease.
##Requirements
 - flask, requests, pandas, spacy, numpy (install using pip)
 - enter the following command: python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
